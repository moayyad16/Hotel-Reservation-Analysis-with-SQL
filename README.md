# Hotel-Reservation-Analysis-with-SQL

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data to derive insights into customer behavior and booking patterns. Using SQL, we explore various aspects of hotel reservations to help hotel management make informed decisions to improve their services and maximize profitability.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is a synthetic collection of hotel bookings. It contains information about booking details such as arrival date, duration of stay, type of customer, number of guests, and booking cancellations.

## Prerequisites
To run the SQL queries provided in this analysis, you will need access to an SQL server and a basic understanding of SQL operations. The following tools are recommended:
- MySQL or PostgreSQL
- Any SQL client such as DBeaver, SQL Workbench, or phpMyAdmin

## Installation
1. Install MySQL or PostgreSQL on your system.
2. Use the SQL client to connect to your database server.
3. Import the hotel booking dataset into your database.

## Files Description
- `Hotel_reservations.sql`: Contains the SQL queries used for the analysis.
- `Hotel Reservation Dataset.csv`: Provides detailed instructions on how to import the dataset into your database.

## Key Insights
1. **Seasonal Trends**: Identification of peak and off-peak seasons for hotel bookings.
2. **Customer Preferences**: Analysis of room preferences among different customer types.
3. **Cancellation Rates**: Examination of cancellation rates to identify patterns and possible reasons for cancellations.
4. **Revenue Analysis**: Insights into the revenue generated from different customer segments.

## Usage
